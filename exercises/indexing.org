Given a sequence of text files, generate two indexes.

The first index is an alphabetical list of all words appearing in the
files followed by a list of pairs.  Each pair is the name of the file
and the number of times that word appears in the file.  For example:

  the : [{child.txt=2}, {mary.txt=1}, {row.txt=1}]

The second index is an alphabetical list of all words appearing in the
files followed by a list of pairs.  Each pair is the name of the file
followed by the positions of that word in the file.  For example:

  the : [{child.txt=[44, 50]}, {mary.txt=[17]}, {row.txt=[7]}]

I suggest working your way up to those challenges.  Start by just
reading a file and parsing it into words.  Then just count the words in
each file.  Then compute the occurrence frequency of each word.  Then
gather the locations of each word in a file.  Then combine the results
for each file into an index of all the files, and so on.

Here's output from a Java solution to those problems.

  ./index child.txt contrary.txt mary.txt row.txt

  Count words in files.
    a : [{child.txt=1}, {contrary.txt=1}, {mary.txt=1}, {row.txt=1}]
    all : [{contrary.txt=1}]
    and : [{child.txt=4}, {contrary.txt=2}, {mary.txt=1}]
    as : [{mary.txt=1}]

FWIW: Those files are nursery rhymes from http://nursery.zelo.com/
      but don't click on that without your sunglasses.

BTW: Feel free to just SLURP (http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/slurp)
     the files, so you don't have to deal with the whole Java IO stack.
     But ... if you wanna get all "web scale" on us, feel free.

     Just for fun, last night I ran the program over text from the
     MOBY-DICK URL at the Project Gutenberg link (which does not work
     now) and found that "ishmael" shows up 20 times.  Correcting for
     lead-in material and normalizing so that the first "Ishmael" is
     at position 3 in the first sentence "Call me Ishmael." I got the
     following list of occurrences.

     [3 1920 2593 2638 2780 3045 13761 19876 25565 30064 30078
      31341 65703 69428 72534 72745 131076 169071 169124 169153]
